# wordle-solver

This is a wordle solver I created a while ago. I forget a little bit about the details of the implementation, but I did essentially manage memory directly through using placed characters in files and creating arrays out of them. It is a relatively good project for refining data structures skills and algorithmic efficiency, as it can get out of hand pretty fast time-wise because of the frequency of searches and the length of them.  There is one unresolved error (I think) about word filtering and a minor error that doesnt allow you to decline words all of the time.
